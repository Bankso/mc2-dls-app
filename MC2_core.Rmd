## Resources to be shared

To help data sharing logistics, please complete the information requested below about the resources to be shared.
The elements of the resource sharing plan are as follows:

### Datasets

- **What**: the nature of the data being shared and how they relate to your overall project, including ‘assay’, ‘format’ and ‘species’, which are controlled vocabulary terms.

- **How much**: how many samples are you measuring? Samples can be considered aliquots/specimens for which you are running a single experiment. If you have multiple experiments, then each gets a separate row in the table below. In the case of single-cell assays, each cell is considered to be a sample.

- **When**: when the resource will be uploaded to the identified storage service.

#### Datasets to be deposited {#deposits}

`r RIA(.F$datasetTable)`

### Tools and computational models

- **Function**: Controlled field; the primary functionality of the computational tool or model.

- **Type**: Controlled field; how the tool or model has been implemented for access by other users.

- **Topic**: Controlled field; general scientific domain the software or model serves.

#### Tools or computational models to be listed {#tools}

`r RIA(.F$toolTable)`

### Biological models

- **Class**: Controlled field; a broad identifier for the type of model.

- **Species**: Controlled field; species identifier for the organism or tissue in which the model was built.

- **Tumor**: Controlled field; the type of tumor the model is intended to recapitulate.
